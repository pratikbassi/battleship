# Pratik's Battleship Game!

This is Pratik Bassi's attempt at the battleship stretch project created by Lighthouse Labs. 
This project was originally made in Node.js, but has since been refactored to use Python. 

This program was written in Python 3.9, and should run on any machine with Python 3.9 or higher installed.

Currently, the game is played in the terminal, with no plans to change this. 
The position and types of the ships are currently hard coded, and both players have to share a terminal.

Further development plans:
- Add local multiplayer (two players over a local network)
- Add AI opponent
- Add randomly placed or manually placed ships
- Improve the terminal interface
